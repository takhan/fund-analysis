Below is a list of the main/exemplar sections in the four LPAs you have provided (from Summit Partners, Better Tomorrow Ventures, 2048 Ventures, TenOneTen Ventures), along with the most "market standard" terms for each where a general consensus appears across documents. Notes are provided where there is commonality/deviation. The below focuses on section headings and key economic, governance, and procedural terms most likely to be referenced by LPs/GPs or side letters.

# **Standard LPA Topics and Market Standard Terms/Values**


## **1. Fund Formation and Structure**

* **Organization/Formation**: All funds formed as Delaware limited partnerships.
    * **Standard**: Formed under Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act.
* **Name**: Specified in the Agreement; GP has latitude to change name.
* **Purpose**: Venture capital investments commonly in early/growth stage private companies; broader language allows investments in securities/other assets (TenOneTen, Summit, BTV, 2048 all similar).
* **Principal Office**, Registered Offic**e/Agent: Address specified, typically can be changed by GP with notice.

## **2. Partnership Term and Extensions**

* **Initial Fund Term**: 10 years from first closing/capital call.
    * **Standard**: 10 years from initial closing/investment date.

    * **Standard**: 2 extensions with majority/advisory board consent.

## **3. Capital Commitments and Contributions**

* **Commitment**: Each LP commits a fixed dollar amount, as shown on the "Schedule of Partners."
* **Capital Calls**: Notice required (typically 10 days, sometimes up to 15 days).
* **GP Commitment**: 1–2% of aggregate commitments minimally (BTV, 2048, TenOneTen); some large funds mandate 5%+ (Summit).
    * **Standard**: 1%–2% for smaller/mid funds; can reach 5% for some large funds.
* **Use of Returned/Recallable Capital**: Capital contributions returned due to broken deals, failed investments, or excess reserves may be re-called and do not count against commitment.
    * **Market Norm**: Recallable capital for broken deal expenses, escrow, or recycling up to 120–125% of aggregate commitments.
* **Recycling**: Can recycle proceeds up to 120–125% of commitments for reinvestment in portfolio companies (Summit 125%, BTV 120%, others similar).
    * **Standard**: Up to 120–125% (recycled capital for broken deals, bridge repayments, etc.).

## **4. Defaulting Limited Partners**

* **Events of Default**: Failure to fund; 10-day notice/cure is industry norm.
* **Remedies**: Forfeiture up to 100% of interest (usually up to 80% or sale/assignment), interest on late payments (often Prime Rate + 6–10%), legal/action costs, possible forced sale of interest, loss of voting rights.
    * **Standard**: Forfeiture of up to 80% of interest, loss of voting rights, forced sale, or promissory note for any balances.

## **5. Management Fee and Expenses**

* **Management Fee Base and Rate**:
    * **Amount**: 2.0%–2.5% on committed capital during investment period (first 3–5 years); drops to 2.0%, 1.5%, or 1.0–1.25% post-investment period or after 4–5 years, then steps down further in late years; occasionally more/less for very large or small funds.
        * **BTV**: 2.5%/2.0%/1.5%; **TenOneTen**: 2.5% stepdown by 0.25% per year after year 4, min 1.25%; **Summit**: starts at 2.0% (with ramp), drops to 1.8%, then stepdown to 1.4% then annual 10% decrement after year 6; **2048**: 4.0% (quarterly 1.0%) for 3 years, then 0%.
            * **Standard**: 2.0% on commitments, stepping down by 0.25–0.5% after year 4/5, and further in later life.
    * **Fee Base**: Commitments reduce to invested capital or NAV, or acquisition cost post-investment period.
    * **GP/Employee Commitment Excluded**: No management fee is paid on the GP's commitment.
* **Fee Offsets/Reductions**: 100% of all transaction/advisory/director/monitoring fees (net of unreimbursed expenses, taxes, etc.) accrue to the benefit of the fund, typically as a direct management fee offset. Some variance on treatment of legal fees, or non-cash compensation.
    * **Standard**: 100% offset against management fee.
* **Fund Expenses**: Standard for all syndication, fund/IV/co-invest/alternative vehicle formation, investment, broken-deal and compliance (incl. AIFMD, FATCA, CFIUS, anti-money laundering) costs, travel, meeting expenses, D&O and other insurance, consultants, legal, audit, and reporting. General GP overhead is NOT chargeable (salaries, rent, office).
    * **Organizational Cap**: Up to 1% of fund size, with all excess offset against management fee. Placement fees typically not included in such cap.

## **6. Allocations, Distributions, and Carried Interest**

* **Distributions**: As realizations occur, subject to maintaining reasonable reserves (60–90 days post-realization common).
* **Order (Waterfall)**:
    * 100% to return of capital, then to preferred return (usually 8% IRR, non-compounded; sometimes more/less, annual or quarterly compounding), then to catch-up and carried interest (most common 20%), then balance split 80/20 or 75/25.
    * **BTV**: 25% carry over a 3x multiple,
    * **Summit**: 20% carry after 8% compounding IRR, then 25% carry above certain thresholds,
    * **TenOneTen**: 20%/25% step up after 2x returns similar, European waterfall.
* **Tax Distributions**: GP may make advances to itself (and sometimes to LPs) to cover estimated tax at the highest marginal rate, treated as advances against future distributions.
* **Clawback/GP Giveback**: Obligatory, typically covers the entire GP group/partners, several not joint, to ensure maximum lifetime carry does not exceed what would have been due if all investments realized at final liquidation; usually net of taxes actually paid, with personal guarantee from carry recipients. Survival period is generally 2–3 years post-final liquidation.
    * **Standard**: Net lifetime excess carry must be returned, with the net-of-tax carveout.

## **7. Investment Restrictions/Policies**

* **Concentration limits**: No more than 10–20% of aggregate commitments in any one Portfolio Company.
* **Public company investments**: Typically max 10–15%.
* **Blind pool investments in other funds**: Limited, usually ≤ 10% (Summit); subject to fee/carry on fund-of-funds.
* **Borrowing**: Allowed for bridging capital calls, usually ≤ 15–20% of aggregate commitments, 90–180 day max maturity.
* **UBTI/ECI limitation**: Standard limitations to minimize UBTI/ECI for tax-exempt and non-US LPs.
* **ERISA**: Partnership will be managed as a VCOC; withdrawal provisions for ERISA/plan asset regulatory triggers.
* **Non-U.S. Considerations**: Blockers, alternate investment vehicles permitted for UBTI/ECI or non-US regulatory needs.
* **Excuse rights**: For regulatory, ERISA, sovereign, or foundation investors where necessary, in a pro-rata fashion.

## **8. Governance: GP Authority, Advisory Board, LP Voting**

* **GP Control**: GP complete discretion over investments, fundraising, management; LPs no rights to manage/cause investment decisions.
* **Advisory Board**: 4–7 members, LP-representatives, appointed by GP, duty is to review conflicts, excuse/exclusion requests, valuation of illiquid assets, consents to extension, removal of GP, etc.
* **Removal/Replacement of GP**:
    * **For Cause (fraud, willful misconduct, conviction)**: removal on 2/3 or 75% in interest (or similar supermajority) vote, sometimes after a “cause” period/event.
    * **No-fault**: 75%–80% in interest to remove GP, no cause needed.
    * **Effect of Removal**: GP’s carry sometimes reduced or forfeited, no more future management fees, remains entitled to carry on “pre-removal” or pre-commitment investments only, new GP appointed by LPs or via advisory board.
* **Key Person Events**: Investment period suspension or possible early termination if key persons (named founders/GPs) cease full-time involvement for a set period (usually 6 months).
* **LP Meetings**: Annual meeting required, allow for virtual. Quarterly reporting required; annual audited financials provided within 90-120 days post-year-end.

## **9. Transfers**

* **LP Transfer Restrictions**:
    * GP consent required to transfer, not unreasonably withheld for affiliates, trusts, etc. No free transfer; must provide legal opinion (may be waived) regarding ERISA, Securities Act, Advisers Act, PTP rules, etc. (see Summit, TenOneTen, 2048, BTV).
    * Assignment of rights/interests can limit economic/voting rights. GP may withhold consent if transfer creates regulatory/plan asset issues or violates max LP count.
    * GP may assign its interest only to affiliates or with 2/3+ LP consent.

## **10. Books and Records, Amendments, General**

* **Right to Books and Records**: Provided for inspection during business hours; confidentiality provisions very strong to avoid FOIA/sunshine disclosure where possible; may deny specific information to an LP if risk of broad disclosure/non-confidentiality.
* **Amendments**: Usually need GP + majority or 2/3 in interest LP consent for material changes, but GP can unilaterally make technical, ministerial, or tax law amendments or those not adverse to LPs.
* **Side Letters**: Allowed, and terms apply solely to side letter counterparty; “most favored nations” structures handled separately.
* **Power of Attorney**: LPs grant GP power of attorney for all fund actions, including investments, amendments, etc.
* **Law/Arbitration**: Delaware law; arbitration mandated (usually JAMS or comparable).
* **Legal Counsel**: GP may have counsel represent fund, GP, and their interests; LPs must retain separate counsel for their own interests.
* **Dissolution**: Fund dissolves upon term expiry, cause/no-fault removal, withdrawal of GP unless 2/3+ in interest LPs elect to continue with new GP.

## **11. ERISA, Tax, and Regulatory (Summit, TenOneTen, 2048, BTV)**

* **ERISA/VCOC**: Reasonable best efforts to structure as VCOC.
* **ERISA/Foundations**: Excuse and withdrawal rights if not possible to structure; process for certification, timing, withdrawal payment terms.
* **Tax**: Standard 704(b), 704(c), 754, 743, and other “safe harbor” allocations. 704(c) is by any method authorized (GP discretion).
* **Withholding**: Standard GP/Partnership right to withhold amounts, netting loans on behalf of LP.
* **Partnership Representative**: GP acts as (or appoints) PR under BBA partnership tax audit rules.

## **12. Confidentiality, CFIUS, AML, KYC, FINRA, Regulatory Clauses**

* **Confidentiality**: Extremely broad—no release of fund docs or financials except as required by court, law, FOIA; FOIA investors have limited disclosure rights; sunsetting/fund-of-funds LPs granted qualified disclosure rights to limited direct equity owners only.
* **AML/KYC**: GP has right to remove/question LP for AML/OFAC violations.
* **CFIUS**: LPs may not control investment or investment committee decisions; legal provisions to “insulate” LPs, especially foreign, from CFIUS/DFIUS review.
* **FINRA**: GP allocates “new issues” in accordance with FINRA rules (5130/5131) and reserves the right to restrict co-invests/new issue allocations for non-eligible LPs.

## **Final Note**

Any deviation from the above in a new LPA would be considered "non-standard" or, at a minimum, market-off for that term. Some of the terms may adjust for fund size, strategy, LP mix, or vintage. All four funds' LPAs reviewed largely fit this framework. The above represents current U.S. VC/PE market norms as of 2024. If you need "off-market" examples or a term-by-term deviation analysis, please specify.
